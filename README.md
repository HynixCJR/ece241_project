# ece241_project: credit card validator and identifier in verilog on an Altera DE1-SOC FPGA board
our ECE241 project, which is an implementation of a credit card number validator/identifier using the Luhn Algorithm.

### part 1
found in the part1 branch.
This part contains code for a shift register to store the user input, an FSM for the Luhn algorithm, and some other miscellaneous parts to listen to user input on switches and keys.
it works, i think.

### part 2

found in the part2 branch.

### part 3

uhhhh i'll figure this part out later but it works!
