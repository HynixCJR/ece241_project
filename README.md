# ece241_project
our ECE241 project, which is an implementation of a credit card number validator/identifier using the Luhn Algorithm.

### part 1
found in the [part1](/part1/) directory.
This part contains code for a shift register to store the user input, an FSM for the Luhn algorithm, and some other miscellaneous parts to listen to user input on switches and keys.
it works, i think.

### part 2
found in the [part2](/part2/) directory.
